Parse your files &&
Execute your files.

Template is just a container that holds all of your parsed templates.
You can execute them all at once (your parced templates) or execute a specific one with a method. Check the docs.

Turn your files into a pointer to a Template type and then write the template you want.

Want to ParseGlob all templates into a single pointer to a Template on init &&
then read from the specific files name in your template container.

func init only runs on start up.

here is how you import data coming into a template. Use the dot.
{{$gf := . }}

this sets whatever data passed in when i execute a parsed file and places it in the variable gf in my file.
<html>
<head>
    <title>More templates</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>The best ever {{$gf}}</h1>
</body>
</html>
